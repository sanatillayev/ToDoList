# SwiftUI Todo List Project

Welcome to the SwiftUI Todo List project! This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Todo List application developed as part of the Swiftfull Thinking course. The project focuses on mastering SwiftUI and implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

## Overview

In this course project, we've created a robust Todo List app that not only showcases the power of SwiftUI but also adopts the best practices of the MVVM architecture. The application incorporates UserDefaults for seamless data persistence between sessions, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the MVVM architecture, providing a clear separation of concerns. The Model handles data layer logic, the View manages the user interface, and the ViewModel contains the business logic, connecting the View to the underlying data models.
- **SwiftUI Mastery:** Throughout the development process, we explored various features and capabilities of SwiftUI, creating a visually appealing and intuitive user interface for the Todo List application.
- **UserDefaults Integration:** The use of UserDefaults ensures that user tasks are saved and persisted, providing a seamless experience across different sessions.

### Learning Objectives

**By exploring this Todo List project, you will gain insights into:**

* SwiftUI essentials and advanced features
* MVVM architecture pattern and its implementation
* Data persistence using UserDefaults
* Building a complete and functional application suitable for submission to the App Store
